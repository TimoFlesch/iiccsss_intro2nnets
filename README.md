# Introduction to Neural Networks
Teaching material for a 2h course on neural networks I gave at the International Interdisciplinary Computational Cognitive Science Spring School in Freiburg, 2019 (http://iiccsss.org/)   

### contents 
The course introduces artificial neural networks as composition of linear and nonlinear functions:
1. Maths Refresher (Calculus)
2. Basics 
    1. Linear Regression
    2. Logistic Regression
    3. (Stochastic) Gradient Descent 
3. Neural Networks 
    1. Architecture
    2. Backpropagation Algorithm
  
I provide code examples in python for each of the sections (except for the maths refresher, obviously)

### material
